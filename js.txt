JS
    -> The javascript is a lightweight client scripting language and is supported by all the browsers. It is highly interactive when used with HTML.

Closures 
    -> The functions which are grouped together with reference of its surrounding state known as lexical environment are called closures.
    -> It is useful in event handling, callbacks, etc.
    -> eg:- 
    function outerFunction() {
        let outerVar = 10;
        function innerFunction() {
            console.log(outerVar); // Inner function "closes over" outerVar
        }
        outerVar = 20; // now this will print 20 in innerfunction because the reference(lexical environment) is passed in closures
        return innerFunction;
    }
    const closure = outerFunction(); // The returned function forms a closure
    closure(); // Outputs: 10

Functions 
    -> There are four different types of functions in javascript:-
        - Named Function: The function whose name is declared at the time of definition is known as named function.
        - Anonymous Function: The function whose name is not declared at the time of definition is known as anonymous function.
        - Arrow Function: The arrow functions are type of anonymous function which 
        - Callback Function: The function which is passed as an arguement to another function is known as callback function.
        - Higher Order Function: The function in which one or more functions are passed as an argument or they can return functions is known as higher order functions. eg: map, filter, reduce, etc.

Hoisting
    -> It is concept where all the declarations appears to be on the top of the code before execution.
    -> The hoisting will occur only in var variable and before they are initialised.
    eg-
    console.log(a); // This is also hoisting and will print undefined
    hoisting(); // This is hoisting and this will run without any error.
    function hoisting() {
        let outerVar = 10;
        console.log(outerVar);
    }

    var a; // this is perfect hoisting
    var a = 9; // This is also hoisting but in above console of a it will print undefined because it is initialised here.
    console.log(a); // This will print 9
